[Cybersecurity Course](https://moringaschool.com/courses/cybersecurity-bootcamp/) 
I completed the **Cybersecurity Bootcamp at Moringa School**, delivered in partnership with **Flatiron School**, where I gained hands‑on experience in Network and Systems Security, Ethical Hacking, Digital Forensics, Risk Management, and Cloud Security. The program emphasized applied skills in Networking, Operating Systems, Python Scripting, Virtualization, and System Hardening, while also covering advanced topics such as Cyber Threat Intelligence aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, SIEM Configuration and Threat Hunting, Security Architecture, Incident Response, and Penetration Testing. Through interactive labs and guided projects, I developed the ability to identify vulnerabilities, secure networks and endpoints, analyze threats, and respond confidently to incidents.
